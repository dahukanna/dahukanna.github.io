# dahukanna.github.io
Github site and summary for repositories.

Since this is a [User Pages site](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/):
> 1. The site is generated from the contents of the master branch.
> 2. The default domain id `<GitHub username>.github.io` i.e. `dahukanna.github.io`.
> 3. The source repository must be named using the `<username>.github.io` convention. I've named mine `dahukanna.github.io`, as my GitHub user name is **"dahukanna"**.

## Why have I done this?
* Meaning and semantics
It's organised the repositories in higher level groups/categories that give easy access to specific repositories based on topics, not the mechanics of their creation e.g. Individual presentations or groups of repos related to a specific topic.
I think of this as adding a semantic browsing layer to the default repository listing page - https://github.com/dahukanna?tab=repositories


* Form
I've used the cards metaphor. Will change this up as other metaphors appeal.


* As an experiment
Trying out some ideas I've had for a while and finally got around to starting.
